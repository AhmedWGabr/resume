    <h1>About Me</h1><hr>
    <p>
        Well, hello there! My name is Ahmed Wahba, and I have been working as a petroleum engineer in the oil and gas industry for over 13 years. I have always been interested in technology, and recently I decided to pursue my passion for coding and become a full stack web developer.
    </p>
    <p>I have already made considerable progress in my coding journey. I have been able to build a mathematical model using Python, and I am excited to continue learning and taking on new challenges. I find coding to be fascinating and challenging, and I am eager to explore the endless possibilities it offers.</p>    
        
    <p>Transitioning from petroleum engineering to web development may seem like a meaningful change, but I believe that my engineering background has prepared me well for this new career path. Both fields require analytical thinking, critical thinking skills, and diligence, and I am confident that I can apply these skills to excel in web development.</p>
        
    <p>I am looking forward to continuing to expand my knowledge and skills in coding, and I am excited to see where this new journey takes me. Whether it is building new web applications or contributing to open-source projects, I am eager to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
